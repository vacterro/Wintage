// a main-process error dialog. Freebuff and CodeNomad both do exactly that. The
// extension pins CommonJS regardless of what the copied manifest says.

// ─── SCROLLBAR GUTTERS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Styling ::-webkit-scrollbar turns Chromium's OVERLAY scrollbars into classic
// ones. Overlay scrollbars are invisible until you scroll, so app authors write
// `overflow: scroll` freely and it costs them nothing — until a theme makes those
// scrollbars classic, and every one of those containers grows a permanent gutter
// with a full-length thumb, on panels that have room to spare. Reported on
// Antigravity, visible on several panels at once.
//
// CSS cannot fix this: there is no selector for "this element's overflow is scroll",
// and blanket-overriding overflow would break containers that need `hidden`. So the
// one narrow change is made from script: computed `scroll` becomes `auto`, which is
// identical when the content actually overflows and hides the gutter when it does
// not. Nothing else is touched.
//
// The SECOND pass is newer and answers the follow-up report — scrollbars that are
// pure decoration, and one that clipped the edge of the Settings button. Those
// containers are on `auto` and DO overflow, by a handful of pixels, because this
// theme itself added a 2px bevel to everything inside them. A scrollbar whose whole
// range is four pixels is not a control, and it costs the panel a full gutter.
//
// `scrollbar-width: none`, not `overflow: hidden`, and the difference is the whole
// safety argument: hiding overflow makes content UNREACHABLE if the guess is wrong
// and the panel later fills up (a chat log is the obvious victim). Hiding only the
// scrollbar keeps the element scrollable by wheel and trackpad no matter what, so
// the worst case of a wrong guess is a missing bar, not lost content. It also
// reclaims the gutter, which `overflow: hidden` would not have done any better.
//
// The decision is re-made, not remembered: a container that grows real content
// gets its scrollbar back on the next pass. That is why NOISE is compared against
// live measurements every time instead of being latched on first sight.
//
// Cost discipline is copied from the userscript, which already paid for this lesson:
// getComputedStyle over a whole document is expensive, so this runs a few bounded

// Chromium does expose the geometry, though: navigator.windowControlsOverlay
// gives the rect the PAGE still owns, so everything outside it in the title strip
// is the overlay. Anything interactive that lands there is moved out from under it
// with a transform -- transform and not margin, because a control positioned
// absolutely (which these usually are) ignores margins entirely.
//
// Deliberately narrow: only small controls, only inside the title strip, and the
